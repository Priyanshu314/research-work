\begin{abstract}
\hspace{}In recent years, the proliferation of smart home devices has created a pressing need for more intuitive user interactions that extend beyond basic control interfaces and error codes. This paper proposes a novel AIoT-driven communication system that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled appliances to facilitate real-time status updates, operational insights, and fault diagnostics in a natural language format. By employing the MQTT protocol for efficient data exchange, smart devices continuously relay operational metrics and alerts to an AI-powered backend, which processes the incoming information and generates contextually relevant, human-readable responses. The interactive output is delivered to users via popular messaging platforms, such as Telegram, or through voice-activated assistants like Alexa. The proposed architecture leverages FastAPI for backend processing and vector storage, ensuring seamless integration and responsiveness. This research aims to enhance user engagement and convenience by transforming the traditional communication paradigm of smart devices, thereby addressing usability gaps identified in existing literature. Ultimately, the system is expected to contribute to the advancement of smart home technologies by creating a more accessible and user-friendly interface for daily interactions with appliances.

\section{Introduction}
hspace{}The implementation of a smart home gateway platform is crucial for efficient data collection and awareness within smart homes \cite{r1}. To ensure secure access to smart home systems, a supervised learning-based authentication framework can be employed \cite{r2}. Additionally, the integration of extended reality technologies can enhance the design of smart built environments, such as smart lighting design testbeds \cite{r3}. Middleware implementation in cloud-mobile ad hoc network (MANET) mobility models is essential for facilitating communication among smart devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem \cite{r4}. Furthermore, the deployment of intrusion detection systems is vital to safeguard smart home IoT devices from potential cyber threats \cite{r5}.

\section{Literature Review}
\hspace{}In the emerging field of smart devices driven by the Internet of Things (IoT), recent research demonstrates a focus on optimizing smart home ecosystem interactions and enhancing security. Studies explore diverse methodologies, including secure authentication frameworks, middleware implementations, and data collection platforms to foster seamless communication between devices and users. A trend towards leveraging machine learning techniques and comparative analyses is evident, particularly concerning intrusion detection systems to safeguard smart environments. However, there exists a gap in integrating natural language processing with these solutions to afford users intuitive and context-aware communication experiences regarding their devices.

\section{Methodology}
\hspace{}The following methodology outlines a structured approach to developing an AIoT-driven communication system that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled appliances. The methodology encompasses several key phases: data collection, system architecture design, model development and training, communication and interaction framework creation, and system evaluation, each justified by the research objectives and literature gaps identified.\\\\Data Collection\\To establish a robust foundation for the proposed system, data collection centers around the acquisition of operational metrics, status updates, and error codes from a diverse array of smart devices. We will utilize the MQTT protocol for efficient real-time data transmission, allowing devices such as washing machines, refrigerators, and TVs to continuously relay pertinent information to the backend infrastructure. The collected data will be stored in a semi-structured format suitable for processing and retrieval, with an emphasis on ensuring data integrity and security during transmission, as highlighted in previous research on secure authentication frameworks (Table 1).\\\\System Architecture Design\\The system architecture comprises three principal components: the IoT-enabled smart devices, the AI-powered backend, and the user interaction interfaces. The backend will be developed using FastAPI, facilitating rapid development and deployment of RESTful APIs that will handle incoming device data and user requests. Additionally, a vector storage solution will be integrated to enable efficient querying of device specifications and user manual information. This design leverages insights from existing middleware implementations in cloud environments to ensure seamless connectivity and communication between devices and the backend (Table 1).\\\\Model Development and Training\\At the core of this research lies the integration of LLMs for natural language processing capabilities. The LLM will be trained on a custom dataset combining device specifications, user manuals, and operational data accrued from the smart appliances. Incorporating techniques from state-of-the-art NLP models enables the system to generate context-aware, human-readable responses that address user queries. The model training process will include fine-tuning on specific tasks such as status updates and fault diagnostics, which directly respond to the identified usability gaps in the existing literature regarding intuitive communication (Gaps in Literature).\\\\Communication and Interaction Framework Creation\\To facilitate user engagement, we will develop a multi-channel communication framework integrating popular messaging platforms like Telegram and voice-activated assistants such as Alexa. The delivery of generated responses will utilize the Twilio API to enable notifications and interactions, ensuring that users receive updates in their preferred format. This multi-channel approach addresses the need for flexible communication methods identified in previous studies on user interactions with smart home devices.\\\\System Evaluation\\An essential stage in our methodology involves a systematic evaluation of the developed system. This will include user testing with a focus group to assess usability, response accuracy, and user satisfaction. The evaluation will utilize quantitative metrics such as response time and qualitative assessments through user feedback. Comparative analyses with existing smart device interfaces will further substantiate the improvements proposed by our system, enhancing confidence in its usability and effectiveness. This aligns with the comparative analyses observed in the literature on intrusion detection systems and their respective impacts on user experience (Table 1).\\\\Through this comprehensive methodology, the proposed research aims to bridge the gap between technical capabilities of smart devices and intuitive user interactions, ultimately fostering enhanced engagement and convenience for users in their smart environments. Each phase is crafted to align with the overarching goals of the study as outlined in the abstract and informed by insights drawn from the literature review.
